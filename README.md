# Assignment 5 – Work-Day Scheduler:
## Summary:
The following application is an hourly work-day scheduler which allows users to add and save information pertinent to each hour of the work-day

## Successses:
* I was able to generate the html through JavaScript
* I was able to display the current date using "moment"
* The page retrieves items form the browser's local storage to populate the work-day planner
* * As such, when the page is refreshed, the items remain on the page
* When the save button is clicked, the events are added to the browser's local storage

## Bugs:
* I was unable to get the current time to show continuously changing by each second
* I was unable to have the colour of each input box change according to the time of day
